1 Abstract
In this paper, I will propose a computational method for 
solving the image transformation puzzles known as Raven’s 
Progressive Matrices test of intelligence, which involves 
finding the missing image in a sequence of images based on 
the transformation applied. My approach utilizes a 2D array 
representation of the images. The percent change between 
each image is calculated, and the answer with the closest 
percent change from the respective slides is selected. I will 
also perform rotations on the images and quadrant analysis 
to improve the accuracy of our method.

2 INTRODUCTION
Image transformation puzzles are a prevalent problem in cognitive psychology, 
which involve finding the missing image in a sequence of images based on the 
transformation applied to each image. The human approach to solving these 
puzzles involves seeing patterns and looking for combinations of changes such 
as shape transformation, rotation, translation, size, and the number of shapes. 
However, this approach is time-consuming and may not be accurate.
3 HUMAN APPROACH
Humans are good at seeing pa erns even when there aren’t any. So the way that I 
would break these down would be to look for combinations of types of changes 
such as shape transformation, rotation, translation, size, and the number of shapes.
First, we would evaluate change from A-B and look for similar changes in C-#.
Then compare the change in A-C with B-#. Finally for B-C match A-#.

4 PROBLEM SELECTION
For this one, we would see A-B and C are the 
same and assume # is also.
For this, A-B has an axis flip and then a shape change 
from a triangle to a square. Then A-C we see another axis
flip with the same shape. So for
#, we can expect a square in the top left 
corner.
This one is more difficult if we only use A-B and A-C. In both of those, we see one 
shape is lost but that lost shape changes in a different direction. But by realizing 
that A-# also has to follow the same logic we would see 5 makes the most sense.

5 Agent Approach
The problem of trying to get a computer to solve these problems as a human would 
is with tracking shapes and being able to quickly see what the transformations are 
between slides.
I instead plan to convert the image into a 2D array of 1s and 0s and check the 
percent change between the different slides and then look for which answer has 
the closest present change from the respective slides. I will also perform 
transformations such as rotating B and C and whichever number of rotations gets 
the slides closest to A, I will do that number to each of the answers and see which 
is closest to that percent change. Lastly, I will break each slide into quadrants and 
look at the change in each quadrant from one slide to the next and try to match 
that in the answers.
4 Challenge
One weakness of this method is its inability to account for overlapping transitions. 
It will also not be able to determine shape changes. Lastly, although this should be 
able to solve the problems for the majority of the sets it is not mimicking how a 
human would approach these problems and not using any predetermined 
knowledge like shapes.
